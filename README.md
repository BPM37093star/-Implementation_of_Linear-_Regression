# Practical 1: Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso) Implementation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing linear regression models using Python. It includes:

- A from-scratch implementation of linear regression using the least squares method with NumPy.
- Polynomial basis expansion to capture non-linear relationships.
- Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques using scikit-learn.
- Learning curve visualization for diagnosing underfitting or overfitting.
- Optional k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.

Datasets used include the Wine Quality dataset and California Housing dataset.
